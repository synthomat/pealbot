pealbot
=======
Pealbot is a simple IRC-Bot written in python. It uses plugins for every function and is thus easy to advance.
The main configuration including server, channel, username and so on can be found in the launcher (pealbot.py).

At the moment it supports:
- switching channels
- add strings to queue
- send any default string from queue to channel
- kill itself
- apply password-protected username
